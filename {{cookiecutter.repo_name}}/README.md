DESC {{cookiecutter.repo_name}} Pipeline Stages
--------------------------

Goals
-----


Installation
------------

Requires python3, numpy, scipy, pyyaml, fitsio, h5py (which in turn needs HDF5), and parsl.

Needs the pipette DESC library on the python path (which is not quite stable enough to be worth a setup.py yet).


Cori
----

These dependencies are all already prepared on cori - use this environment:

```bash
module swap PrgEnv-intel  PrgEnv-gnu
module unload darshan
module load hdf5-parallel/1.10.1
module load python/3.6-anaconda-4.4
module load cfitsio/3.370-reentrant
source activate /global/projecta/projectdirs/lsst/groups/WL/users/zuntz/env
```

Running the pipeline
--------------------

Make sure that the pipette directory is on your PYTHONPATH and pipette/bin is on your PATH.
Then you can run:

```bash
pipette test/test.yml
```
to run the implemented stages

Implementation
--------------

Each pipeline stage is implemented as a python class inheriting from pipette.Pipeline stage.  These subclasses should:

- have a "name" attribute string.
- have class attributes "inputs" and "outputs", each of which is a list of tuple pairs with a string tag and a FileType class.
- (optionally)  define a "config_options" dictionary of options it expects to find in its section of the main config file, with the value as a default for the option or "None" for no default.
- implement a "run" method doing the actual work of the class.  Your class should then call the methods described below to interact with the pipeline


Some implementation notes:

- Our catalogs will be large. Wherever possible stages should operate on chunks of their input data at once. Pipette has some methods for this (see README)
- Pipeline stages shouldn't copy existing columns to new data.
- No ASCII output allowed!
- Python 3.6
- We will do code review
- One file per box (?)

Pipeline Stage Methods
----------------------

The pipeline stages can use these methods to interact with the pipeline:

Basic tools to find the file path:

- self.get_input(tag)
- self.get_output(tag)

Get base class to find and open the file for you

- self.open_input(tag, **kwargs)
- self.open_output(tag, **kwargs)


Look for a section in a yaml input file tagged "config"
and read it.  If the config_options class variable exists in the class
then it checks those options are set or uses any supplied defaults:

- self.read_config()

Parallelization tools - MPI attributes:

- self.rank
- self.size
- self.comm

(Parallel) IO tools - reading data in chunks, splitting up
according to MPI rank:

- self.iterate_fits(tag, hdunum, cols, chunk_rows)
- self.iterate_hdf(tag, group_name, cols, chunk_rows)
